**The Snake** is a video game that is popular all over the world especially with Nokia
mobile phones. It is played by a sole player who controls
direction in which a snake will move and hence its objective is to eat items (in my case, an apple) by running
into them with its head, while they (the items) would
emerge in random places within bounded board. Each eaten item
makes the snake longer, so maneuvering becomes progressively
more difficult.
